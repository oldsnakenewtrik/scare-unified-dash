# Railway Deployment Diagnostic Guide

## Problem Discovered

We found that all API endpoints are returning 404 errors wrapped in 200 OK responses. This indicates a deployment configuration issue where the frontend and API may not be correctly connected.

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Railway Services**:
   - Log into Railway dashboard
   - Verify if you have separate services for frontend and backend
   - If so, make sure both are deployed successfully

2. **Check API Deployment**:
   - Verify if your FastAPI application is running correctly
   - Look at Railway logs for any startup errors in the API service

3. **Check API Base Path**:
   - Your FastAPI app might be deployed at a subpath
   - Try accessing `https://your-app-url.up.railway.app/docs` to see if Swagger UI loads
   - If it does, your API is running but might be at a different path than expected

4. **Check Railway Networking**:
   - Make sure your services are correctly networked if they're separate
   - You may need to configure Railway to route `/api/*` requests to your API service

## Possible Solutions

1. **If using separate services**:
   - Set up a Railway plugin or configuration to route `/api/*` requests to your backend service
   - Configure CORS properly on the backend to accept requests from your frontend origin

2. **If using a single service**:
   - Make sure your FastAPI app is correctly mounted at the expected path
   - Check the FastAPI routes are defined correctly with the expected prefixes

3. **Railway-specific solution**:
   - Consider using Railway's internal networking features if you have separate services
   - Use environment variables to dynamically set the backend URL in your frontend

## Testing After Deployment

Once deployed, run this script in your browser console to verify API endpoints:

```javascript
async function testApiEndpoints() {
  const endpoints = [
    '/api/campaign-mappings',
    '/api/unmapped-campaigns',
    '/api/campaigns-hierarchical',
    '/api/campaign-metrics'
  ];
  
  console.log('====== API ENDPOINT TESTING ======');
  
  for (const endpoint of endpoints) {
    try {
      console.log(`Testing endpoint: ${endpoint}`);
      const response = await fetch(endpoint);
      const status = response.status;
      const json = await response.json();
      
      console.log(`Status: ${status}`);
      console.log('Response data:', json);
      console.log('Is array?', Array.isArray(json));
      console.log('----------------------------');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error testing ${endpoint}:`, error);
      console.log('----------------------------');
    }
  }
}

testApiEndpoints();
```
